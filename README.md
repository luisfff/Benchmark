# Benchmark

A code example demonstrating the use of the BenchmarkDotNet library to compare the performance of different algorithms.

## Features

Comparison of different algorithms

Output of performance metrics such as mean execution time and standard deviation.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/luisfff/benchmark

Restore dependencies: `dotnet restore`

Run the benchmarks: `dotnet run`

The output will show the comparison of the algorithms

## Customization

Add new algorithms to compare by creating a new algorithms class

Change the parameters of the algorithms to be compared by modifying the methods in the algorithms class
